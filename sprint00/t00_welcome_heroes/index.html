        <h2 id="superhero_address">What makes a superhero?</h2>

        <p>
            A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to
            do them in a way that a normal person couldn&apos;t.
            So in order to be a superhero, <b>you need a power that is more exceptional than any power 
            a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. 
            Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero. 
            <br>For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be
            just a regular police story or detective story
            or human-interest story. But if itâ€™s a good guy with a superpower
            who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a
            superhero story. If the good guy is doing something that a
            normal human being couldn&apos;t do, couldn&apos;t
            accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.

        <p>Aquaman</p>

        <p>
            Aquaman, known as Arthur Curry, gained his superpowers due to his heritage - he is a
            mixed descendant of a human and an Atlantean, which grants him strength,
            speed and the ability to control the water elements. After realizing his heritage
            and learning aquatic magical techniques, he accepted the role of Aquaman, protector
            of the deep sea and peace on Earth.
